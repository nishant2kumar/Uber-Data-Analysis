# Uber-Data-Analysis
Uber and Lyft's ride prices are not constant like public transport. They are greatly affected by the demand and supply of rides at a given time. There are two data present in this dataset one is Cab Ride data and another one is Weather data. The Cab ride data covers various types of cabs for Uber &amp; Lyft and their price for the given location and Weather data contains weather attributes like temperature, rain, cloud, etc for all the locations taken into consideration. From this dataset I have tried to analyze the prices of these ride-sharing apps and try to figure out what factors are driving the demand. Do Mondays have more demand than Sunday at 9 am? Do people avoid cabs on a sunny day?
